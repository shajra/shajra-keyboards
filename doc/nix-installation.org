* Org-mode setup :noexport:

This document is written in a project-agnostic way to be copied to other
projects that use Nix.

** Variables

We set variables in =internal/params.el= and access those settings with the
following macros and source code blocks (using Noweb).

#+name: get
#+begin_src emacs-lisp :var arg="" :eval yes :results silent
(alist-get (intern arg) (car (read-from-string (f-read "internal/params.el"))))
#+end_src

#+macro: get (eval (concat $2 (alist-get (intern $1) (car (read-from-string (f-read "internal/params.el")))) $3))
#+macro: nix-latest {{{get(nix-latest)}}}
#+macro: nix-stable {{{get(nix-stable)}}}
#+macro: nixos-latest {{{get(nixos-latest)}}}
#+macro: platforms {{{get(platforms)}}}

* About this document

This document explains how to
- install [[nix][the Nix package manager]]
- set up Nix to download pre-built packages from a cache (optionally)
- set up the Nix's experimental flakes feature (optionally)

If you're unsure if you want to enable flakes or not, read the provided
[[file:nix-introduction.org][introduction to Nix]].

* Prerequisites

This project supports {{{platforms}}}.

All we need to use this project is to install Nix, which this document covers.
Nix can be installed on a variety of Linux and Mac systems. Nix can also be
installed in Windows via the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Installation on
WSL may involve steps not covered in this documentation, though.

Note, some users may be using [[nixos][NixOS]], a Linux operating system built on top of
Nix. Those users already have Nix and don't need to install it separately. You
don't need to use NixOS to use this project.

* Level of commitment/risk

Unless you're on NixOS, you're likely already using another package manager for
your operating system (APT, DNF, etc.). You don't have to worry about Nix or
packages installed by Nix conflicting with anything already on your system.
Running Nix alongside other package managers is safe.

All the files of a Nix package are located under =/nix= a directory, isolated
from any other package manager. Nix won't touch critical directories under
=/usr= or =/var=. Nix then symlinks files under =/nix= to your home directory
under dot-files like =~/.nix-profile=. There is also some light configuration
under =/etc/nix=.

Hopefully, this alleviates any worry about installing a complex program on your
machine. Uninstallation is not too much more than deleting everything under
=/nix=.

* Nix package manager installation

#+begin_quote
*_NOTE:_* You don't need this step if you're running NixOS, which comes with Nix
baked in.
#+end_quote

Though the latest version of Nix is Nix {{{nix-latest}}}, we'll be installing
the version that the last release of NixOS ({{{nixos-latest}}}) uses,
specifically Nix {{{nix-stable}}}.  As discussed in the included [[file:nix-introduction.org][introduction to
Nix]], this version is considered stable by the Nix community.

The following command calls the official installation script for the recommended
version of Nix.  Note, this script will require =sudo= access.

#+begin_src bash :eval no :noweb yes
sh <(curl -L https://releases.nixos.org/nix/nix-<<get("nix-stable")>>/install) --daemon
#+end_src

The =--daemon= switch installs Nix in the multi-user mode, which is generally
recommended (single-user installation with =--no-daemon= instead is recommended
for WSL). The script reports everything it does and touches.

After installation, you may have to exit your terminal session and log back in
to have environment variables configured, which puts Nix executables on your
=PATH=.

Every six months or so, a new version of NixOS releases, and you should consider
upgrading your installation of Nix.  For NixOS {{{nixos-latest}}}, this command
upgrades Nix:

#+begin_src bash :eval no :noweb yes
NIXOS_VERSION="<<get("nixos-latest")>>"
NIX_STORE_PATHS_URL=https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/raw/$NIXOS_VERSION/nixos/module/installer/tools/nix-fallback-paths.nix
sudo nix upgrade-nix --nix-store-paths-url "$NIX_STORE_PATHS_URL"
#+end_src

For [[nixos-releases][new releases of NixOS]], use the same command with new =NIXOS_VERSION=.

The Nix manual describes [[nix-install-manual][other methods of installing Nix]] that may suit you more.
If you later want to uninstall Nix, see the [[nix-uninstall][uninstallation steps documented in
the Nix manual]].

* Cache setup

This project pushes built Nix packages to two substituters, [[garnix][Garnix]] and [[cachix][Cachix]],
as part of its continuous integration. It's recommended to install at least one
of these. Configuring both to have a fallback works as well. Garnix caches a few
more packages than Cachix. Both should have similar availability.

We need to extend two settings in either the system-level Nix configuration file
at =/etc/nix/nix.conf=, or the user-level configuration at
=~/.config/nix/nix.config= (which may not exist yet).

The choice of whether to perform these settings system-level or user-level is up
to your preference.

First we need to specify one or both of the following substituters:
- https://cache.garnix.io
- https://shajra.cachix.org

For each substituter we use, we need to also configure Nix to trust their public
keys:
- cache.garnix.io:CTFPyKSLcx5RMJKfLo5EEPUObbA78b0YQ2DTCJXqr9g=
- shajra.cachix.org-1:V0x7Wjgd/mHGk2KQwzXv8iydfIgLupbnZKLSQt5hh9o=

** System-level cache configuration

When editing the =/etc/nix/nix.conf= as root, suffix the new substituter(s),
space-separated to any values already populating the =substituters= parameter.

Next, similarly suffix the key(s) to the =trusted-public-keys= parameter.

Your file will likely look like the following:

#+begin_example
…
substituters = https://cache.nixos.org/ https://cache.garnix.io https://shajra.cachix.org
trusted-public-keys = cache.nixos.org-1:6NCHdD59X431o0gWypbMrAURkbJ16ZPMQFGspcDShjY= cache.garnix.io:CTFPyKSLcx5RMJKfLo5EEPUObbA78b0YQ2DTCJXqr9g= shajra.cachix.org-1:V0x7Wjgd/mHGk2KQwzXv8iydfIgLupbnZKLSQt5hh9o=
…
#+end_example

** User-level cache configuration

User-level Nix configuration overrides system-level settings. For user-level
configuration, we can use the =extra-substituters= and
=extra-trusted-public-keys= parameters to extend =substituters= and
=trusted-public-keys= settings already in the system-level =/etc/nix/nix.conf=
file. This way we don't need to worry about accidentally excluding the standard
https://cache.nixos.org substituter where we get most of our cache hits.

For user-level Nix configuration, create a file at =~/.config/nix/nix.conf= with
the following content:

#+begin_example
…
extra-substituters = https://cache.garnix.io https://shajra.cachix.org
extra-trusted-public-keys = cache.garnix.io:CTFPyKSLcx5RMJKfLo5EEPUObbA78b0YQ2DTCJXqr9g= shajra.cachix.org-1:V0x7Wjgd/mHGk2KQwzXv8iydfIgLupbnZKLSQt5hh9o=
#+end_example

** Testing your configuration

You can see that your configuration is correct with the following commands:

#+name: nix-config-test
#+begin_src sh :eval no
nix show-config substituters
nix show-config trusted-public-keys
#+end_src

Make sure still have settings for https://cache.nixos.org.

* Setting up experimental features

This project can take advantage of two experimental Nix features:
- =nix-command=
- =flakes=

The provided [[file:nix-introduction.org][introduction to Nix]] covers in detail what these features are and
can help you decide whether you want to enable them.

As you can guess, the =flakes= feature enables flakes functionality in Nix. The
=nix-command= feature enables a variety of subcommands of Nix's newer =nix=
command-line tool, some of which allow us to work with flakes.

If you don't enable experimental features globally, there is a switch to enable
features local to just a single command-line invocation. For example, to use
flakes-related commands, we call ~nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command
flakes' …~.  When not configuring globally, setting an alias for this can be
useful. The following command illustrates setting an alias in most
POSIX-compliant shells:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
alias nix-flakes = nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'
#+end_src

As discussed in the introduction, =nix-command= is enabled by default. You don't
need to enable it explicitly (though you could disable it).

The easiest way to turn on experimental features is to put the following setting
into either the system-level =/etc/nix/nix.conf= file or the user-level
=~/.config/nix/nix.conf= file:

#+begin_src text :eval no
experimental-features = nix-command flakes
#+end_src

Then you should see that the appropriate features are enabled:

#+name: nix-show-config
#+begin_src sh :results output :export both
nix show-config experimental-features
#+end_src

#+RESULTS: nix-show-config
: flakes nix-command
