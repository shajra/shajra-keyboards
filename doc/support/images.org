#+title: Keymap Image Management
#+setupfile: ../../doc/internal/links.org

I made my keyboard layout images with [[http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com][a service]] that has been
un/under-maintained for some years, but keeps on functioning. The image-export
feature of this website doesn't meet my satisfaction, so I have the following
process, which I haven't automated:

1. Take a screenshot of the images with my browser zoomed in at 150%.
2. From the GNU Image Manipulation Program
  a. Use =Image → Crop to Content=
  b. =File → Export As…= a PNG
3. Reduce the filesize with the following ImageMagik command.

#+begin_src sh :eval no
convert image.oversized.png
    -colors 256 \
    -strip \
    -quality 95 \
    -define png:compression-level=9 \
    -define png:compression-strategy=1 \
    image.compressed.png
#+end_src

I haven't had the desire to automate this because the process is so tenuous and
I have made changes to my keymaps so infrequently. This document is enough for
me to retrace my steps.
