* About this document

This document is a quick introduction to the Nix programming language.

You can use the [[nix][Nix]] command-line tools without understanding the programming
language (also called Nix). However, learning the Nix language, will allow you
to develop your own Nix packages and read the source code of others. A lot of
this code is in [[nixpkgs][Nixpkgs]], a centralized repository of Nix code for the entire Nix
ecosystem.

The Nix community has recently developed [[nix-language-tutorial][a tutorial for the language]], which may
be a good alternative or supplement to this document.

This document is no substitute for the [[nix-language-manual][official Nix language documentation]],
which is not that long for a programming language. Nix does not have much syntax
relative to other general-purpose programming languages.

* Prerequisites

You can read this document without following along on your own computer.

If you do want to follow along, you need to [[file:nix-installation.org][install Nix]]. When installing Nix you
will need to have the =nix-command= experimental feature enabled to follow along
with this document. You won't need =flakes= enabled, though.

* Primitive literals

We can play around with the Nix language with the =nix eval= command. As with
many languages, we can use Nix as a simple calculator by passing Nix expressions
to it:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '1 + 1'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 2

Note, we just have to quote our entire expression for a shell invocation. For an
interactive session where this quoting isn't needed, you can use the =nix repl=
command.

Nix supports a variety of types you'd expect for a programming language, and we
get some literal syntax for typical primitives:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'builtins.typeOf 1'
nix eval --expr 'builtins.typeOf 1.0'
nix eval --expr 'builtins.typeOf true'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "int"
: "float"
: "bool"

Though not covered here in great detail, primitives support the typical
operations one would expect. For instance, we have =||=, =&&=, and =!= for
boolean values. Numeric values have typical arithmetic operators of =+=, =-=,
=/=, and =*=. And we can compare all values with ====.

* Strings

As you may expect from other languages, Nix supports string literals with the
conventional double quote syntax:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'builtins.typeOf "hello"'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "string"

Nix also supports multi-line strings with two consecutive single quotes:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr "''
      line 1
        line 2
    line 3 ''"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "  line 1\n    line 2\nline 3 "

The left-most token in any line establishes a left margin. In the example above,
this is ~line 3~. Beyond these strings, Nix does not have syntactically
significant whitespace.

We concatenate strings with the =+= operator:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '"a" + "b"'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "ab"

* Let-expressions

Because of Nix's foundation as a “functional” programming language, you can't
repeatedly bind values to variables as you may in other “imperative” languages.
When we bind a value to a name, it's permanently bound for the entire scope the
name exists within. We manage these scopes of bound names with
/let-expressions/:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'let a = 1; b = 2; in a + b'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3

In this example, we've bound =a= to 1, and =b= to 2, but only for the scope of
the expression that follows the =in= keyword, =a + b=.

As illustrated below, we can't rebind a name:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'let a = 1; a = 2; in a' 2>&1 || true
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: error: attribute 'a' already defined at «string»:1:5
: 
:        at «string»:1:12:
: 
:             1| let a = 1; a = 2;
:              |            ^

Note that semicolons are mandatory in all Nix forms that have them, including
let-expressions. Because of Nix's strict parsing you can neither elide
semicolons, nor put extra ones.

* String interpolation

Sometimes we build up small code snippets inline in a Nix expression, so it's
useful to have string interpolation support. Similar to shell scripting, the
syntax for this follows:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '
    let foo = "Foo";
        bar = "Bar";
    in "${foo + bar} is a terrible name"'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "FooBar is a terrible name"

String interpolation is supported by both normal and multi-line strings.

You can only interpolate strings into strings. For instance, interpolating an
integer won't work:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '
    let a_number = 42;
    in "${a_number} is a terrible number"' 2>&1 || true
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
error:
       … while evaluating a path segment

         at «string»:3:9:

            2|     let a_number = 42;
            3|     in "${a_number} is a terrible number"
             |         ^

       error: cannot coerce an integer to a string
#+end_example

We can use a builtin =toString= function to coerce types to strings:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '
    let a_number = 42;
    in "${builtins.toString a_number} is a terrible number"' 2>&1 || true
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "42 is a terrible number"

Note that unlike shell scripts, the curly braces are not optional for string
interpolation in Nix. This works out in our favor if we're writing shell scripts
inline in a Nix expression, because we can use ~$name~ for shell string
interpolation and ~${nix_expr}~ for Nix string interpolation. If this is not
enough, within multiline strings, we can suppress interpolation with by using
=''${…}= instead of just =${…}=.

This is a little tedious to illustrate in a shell example without dealing with
quote delimiting. In the following example, the shell will interpolate, but not
the final Nix expression because we have =''$= instead of just =$= in our final
string:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
FROM_SHELL='${NOT_EXPANDED_BY_NIX}'
nix eval --expr "''In ''$FROM_SHELL expansion is prevented.''"
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "In \${NOT_EXPANDED_BY_NIX} expansion is prevented."

Here's the same example without the suppression of the interpolation:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
FROM_SHELL='${EXPANDED_BY_NIX}'
nix eval --expr "''In $FROM_SHELL expansion still happens.''" 2>&1 || true
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: error: undefined variable 'EXPANDED_BY_NIX'
: 
:        at «string»:1:8:
: 
:             1| ''In ${EXPANDED_BY_NIX} expansion still happens.''
:              |        ^

* Functions

Nix has first class functions. Nix's functions take in only one argument at a
time, and use a colon to separate the parameter name from the body of the
function. Furthermore, Nix uses whitespace for function application:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'builtins.typeOf (a: a + 1)'
nix eval --expr '(a: a + 1) 2'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "lambda"
: 3

Since functions take only one argument at a time, we encode n-ary functions with
functions returning functions:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '(a: b: a + b) 1 2'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3

In this case, when we apply ~1~ to ~a: b: a + b~, we get another function. When
we apply ~2~ to this resultant function, we finally get our answer ~3~.

If you've heard of /currying a function/ in other languages with n-ary
functions, you may recognize this technique.

* Lists

Nix also has list literals, which use square brackets and are
whitespace-delimited:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'builtins.typeOf [1 2 3 4 5]'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "list"

We can append lists together with the =++= operator:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '[1 2] ++ [3 4]'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [ 1 2 3 4 ]

The elements of a list in Nix do not have to be the same type, and lists can be
nested:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '[1 "hello" [true]]'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: [ 1 "hello" [ true ] ]

* Attribute sets

Very importantly, Nix has a kind of map called an /attribute set/ that is
specialized to have textual indices called /attributes/ that index values of
arbitrary types. It uses the following syntax:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'builtins.typeOf { a = 1; b = 2; }'
nix eval --expr '{ a = 1; b = 2; }'
nix eval --expr '{ a = 1; b = 2; }.b'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "set"
: { a = 1; b = 2; }
: 2

Note, =builtins= is just an attribute set that is in scope by default. And
=typeOf= is just an attribute that maps to a function that returns a string
indicating the type of the argument.

Often used in Nix expressions, we can overlay sets on top of each other with the
=//= operator:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '{ a = 1; b = 2; } // { b = 3; c = 4; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: { a = 1; b = 3; c = 4; }

Additionally, we can prefix set literals with the =rec= keyword to get recursive
sets. Recursive sets allow values in a set to reference attributes by name:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'rec { a = b; b = 2; }.a'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 2

Without the =rec= keyword, we'd get an error:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '{ a = b; b = 2; }.a' 2>&1 || true
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: error: undefined variable 'b'
: 
:        at «string»:1:7:
: 
:             1| { a = b; b = 2; }.a
:              |       ^

If a function accepts an attribute set as an argument, we can have Nix
destructure the set as a convenience with the following pattern syntax:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '({ a, b }: a + b ) { a = 1; b = 2; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3

This basic pattern syntax is rigid, and we can't pass in a attribute set with
attributes that don't match the pattern:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '({ a }: a + 2 ) { a = 3; b = 4; }' 2>&1 || true
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
error:
       … from call site

         at «string»:1:1:

            1| ({ a }: a + 2 ) { a = 3; b = 4; }
             | ^

       error: function 'anonymous lambda' called with unexpected argument 'b'

       at «string»:1:2:

            1| ({ a }: a + 2 ) { a = 3; b = 4; }
             |  ^
       Did you mean a?
#+end_example

If we want to relax the destructuring to accept sets with other attributes we
can use a “...” form:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '({ a, ...}: a + 2 ) { a = 3; b = 4; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 5

When destructuring, we can still bind the whole set to a name if we want to
using a “@” form.

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr '(s@{ a, b }: a + s.b ) { a = 2; b = 3; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 5

Attribute sets also support an additional syntactic convenience when pulling in
locally bound values as attributes, which comes up a lot in Nix. For example,
consider the way we're using ~a = a~ here:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'let a = 3; in { a = a; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: { a = 3; }

Rather than worrying about spelling the same name correctly both sides of
the ‘=’ for an attribute setting, we can use the =inherit= keyword:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'let a = 3; in { inherit a; }'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: { a = 3; }

* Paths

Because the Nix language was designed for building packages, file paths come up
frequently in Nix expressions. Nix conveniently has a /path/ type, indicated by
identifiers with at least one slash:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
nix eval --expr 'builtins.typeOf /some/filepath'
nix eval --expr '/some/filepath'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: "path"
: /some/filepath

* Mutable (dangerous) path references

#+begin_quote
*WARNING:* This section discusses a language feature of Nix that should be
avoided in Nix expressions. Use of this feature can lead to subtle build
breakages depending on how you've set the =NIX_PATH= environment variable. This
section is included only to explain the feature if you encounter it in other's
code.
#+end_quote

Up until now, all the Nix expressions we've seen have been purely deterministic.
=1 + 1= will always evaluate to =2=. This is a valuable property for a build
tool. If a Nix expression describes how to build a package, we want to build
it consistently every time.

Unfortunately, Nix has a special environment variable =NIX_PATH= which can
provide mutable path references. For expressions that use the syntax described
in this section, Nix expressions may reference paths that could change
dynamically based on how =NIX_PATH= has been set. Builds relying on this are
intrinsically non-deterministic.

=NIX_PATH= is a legacy environment variable, that the ecosystem is slowly
working to phase out. To assist with this, the =nix= command requires an
=--impure= switch to evaluate an expressions that access mutable paths.

As with =PATH=, the settings within =NIX_PATH= are colon-delimited, with earlier
settings taking precedence over later ones. There are two forms for setting
=NIX_PATH=:

- ~<name>=<filepath>~
- ~<directory>~

In a Nix expression, we can use an angle bracket syntax to search =NIX_PATH= for
an existent file path. Here's an example of using =NIX_PATH= to set the name
“temporary” to =/tmp=, which we then access with ~<temporary>~:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
NIX_PATH=temporary=/tmp nix eval --impure --expr '<temporary>'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /tmp

If we create some files or folders there:

#+begin_src sh :results silent
mkdir --parents /tmp/some.d/path
#+end_src

Then we can access them using our name as a path prefix in our angle
brackets:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
NIX_PATH=temporary=/tmp nix eval --impure --expr '<temporary/some.d/path>'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /tmp/some.d/path

If we use the second form for =NIX_PATH=, can specify directories without a
name. These directories are then used as candidate prefixes until an existent
path if found. For example, we can consider =/tmp= as a path prefix when looking
up =some.d/path= to find =/tmp/some.d/path=:

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports both
NIX_PATH=/tmp nix eval --impure --expr '<some.d/path>'
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: /tmp/some.d/path

Now you know about the angle bracket syntax, but please never use it. It's
generally caused the Nix community grief. The Nix community looks bad when a
build system advertising deterministic builds fails to do so. There's almost
always a better way to accomplish what you might with mutable path references.

* Other (mutable) dangers

There's other ways to have mutable references in Nix, but the angle notation
discussed in the prior section is the most common found across various projects
and legacy documentation.

For instance, it's possible to use some functions found on the =builtins= set to
fetch files from the internet. Here's one such example:

#+begin_src sh :eval no :exports code
nix eval --impure --expr '
    builtins.fetchGit {
        url = "https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf";
    }
'
#+end_src

#+begin_src sh :results output :exports results
nix eval --impure --expr '
    builtins.fetchGit {
        url = "https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf";
    }
' | nixfmt
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
#+begin_example
{
  lastModified = 1695801302;
  lastModifiedDate = "20230927075502";
  narHash = "sha256-pP/DBhsYFpYQ7RqB4+1Iy9B1jPlC1rNT3aZhhr1Z9EU=";
  outPath = "/nix/store/i0rgmq3dd0407n5b3jxkvs60gw3qpz1d-source";
  rev = "917ea45b79de04f69059f42a8e2621f7caeae1c9";
  revCount = 842;
  shortRev = "917ea45";
  submodules = false;
}
#+end_example

Notice that because we're referencing a URL on the internet that might change
=nix eval= forces us to use the =--impure= switch to perform this evaluation.

In general, exercise caution any time calling a nix command with =--impure=.

* Importing

We can import paths. If the path is a file, it's loaded as a Nix expression. If
it's a directory, a file called “default.nix” is loaded within it.

The Nixpkgs source code, for example, has a =default.nix= file at its root, so
we can import a path directly to it

Here's a small example that creates two files, one that imports the other:

#+begin_src sh :dir .. :results output :exports both
mkdir nix_example

echo '{ a = 3; }' > nix_example/set.nix
echo '(import ./set.nix).a' > nix_example/default.nix

nix eval --file ./nix_example
#+end_src

#+RESULTS:
: 3

We also see here use of the =--file= switch with =nix=. This is useful when an
expression is saved in a file.
