** Variables

We set variables in =internal/params.el= and access those settings with the
following macros.

#+macro: get (eval (concat $2 (alist-get (intern $1) (car (read-from-string (f-read "internal/params.el")))) $3))

* About this document

This document introduces the [[nix][Nix package manager]] and highlights some motivations
to use Nix. It also covers the tradeoffs of using Nix and experimental features
in Nix, such as /flakes/.

This document tries to capture enthusiasm while being honest about frustrations.
Nix is a pioneer of an architectural approach that users will demand in the
future. However, users need clear information up front where they are likely to
face challenges.

* Problems addressed by Nix

The following sections cover various problems that Nix's architecture addresses.

** Complete build

When dealing with a new software project, wrangling dependencies can be a chore.
Modern build systems for specific programming languages often don't manage
system dependencies. For example, Python's =pip install= will download and
install needed Python dependencies but may fail if the system doesn't provide
shared libraries required for foreign function calls. Adding complexity,
different operating systems have differing names for these system packages and
install them with various commands (=apt=, =dnf=, etc.). This variation makes
automation difficult. Consequently, many software projects only provide
documentation as a surrogate for automation, which creates even more room for
error.

** Reliable build

Some projects might have all the automation necessary for building, but due to
subtle differences among systems, what builds on one system might not build on
another.

For example, environment variables often can influence the behavior of the
commands called by scripts. It's hard to lock down these variables on every
system where something might be built.

** Reliable deployment

Once we've built some software and are ready to deploy it, it's not always
obvious how to copy this built software to another system. For example, if the
software dynamically links to system libraries, we need to know whether those
libraries are on our target system.

** Version conflicts

Another complication we face is when an operating system only allows one
installed version of a system library at a time. When this happens, we may be
forced to make difficult choices if we need two programs requiring different
system dependency versions.

** Polyglot programming

It can be tedious to synthesize libraries and programs from different language
ecosystems to make a new program for a unified user experience. For example, the
world of machine learning often requires the mixing of C/C++, Python, and even
basic shell scripts. These hybrid applications tend to be fragile.

** Distributed cache of builds

Various build systems provide repositories for pre-built packages, which helps
users save time by downloading packages instead of building them. We want this
experience unified across all programming language ecosystems and system
dependencies.

Note this is what traditional package managers like DNF and APT accomplish.
However, there's an ergonomic difficulty in turning all software into standard
Linux packages. Firstly, there are too many Linux distributions with too many
package managers. Secondly, most package managers must adhere to policies for
everything to work well together. For example, many distributions respect the
[[fhs][Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS)]]. Confusion around policies has led many
developers to steer away from package managers and toward container-based
technologies like Docker despite the overhead and drawbacks of containers.

* Nix at a high level

Nix addresses all the problems discussed above.

To build or install any project, we should be able to start with only the Nix
package manager installed. No other library or system dependency should be
required to be installed or configured.

Even if we have a library or system dependency installed, it shouldn't interfere
with any build or installation we want to do. Nix builds and installs in its own
meticulously sandboxed and controlled directories.

Our build should get everything we need, all the way down to the system-level
dependencies, irrespective of which programming language the dependencies have
been authored in. If anything has been pre-built, we should download a cached
result.

Above and beyond the problems discussed above, Nix has a precisely deterministic
build, generally guaranteeing reproducibility. If the package builds on one
system, it should build on all systems, regardless of what's installed.
Furthermore, multiple systems independently building the same package will often
produce bit-for-bit identical builds.

Nix is also able to copy the transitive closure of a package's dependencies
ergonomically from one system to another.

In broad strokes, Nix is a technology that falls into two categories:

- package manager
- build tool.

** Nix the package manager

As a package manager, Nix does what most package managers do. Nix provides a
suite of command-line tools to search registries of known packages, as well as
install and uninstall them.

Packages can provide both executables and plain files alike. Installation
entails putting these files into a good location for the package manager and the
user. Nix has an elegant way of storing everything under =/nix/store=, discussed
more below.

Notably, the Nix package manager doesn't differentiate between system- and
user-level installations. All packages end up in =/nix/store=. These packages
are hermetic and can't conflict with one another. To save space, packages often
share common elements via symlinks to other packages in =/nix/store=.

As a convenience, Nix has tools to help users put the executables provided by
packages on their environment's =PATH=. This way, users don't have to find
executables installed in =/nix/store=.

** Nix the build system

Nix combines the features of a package manager with those of a build tool. If a
package or any of its dependent packages (including low-level system
dependencies) aren't found in a /Nix substituter/, Nix builds them locally.
Otherwise, Nix downloads pre-built packages cached in the substituter. We only
need the Nix package manager and a network connection to build or download any
package.

Every Nix package is specified by a /Nix expression/, written in a small
programming language also called Nix. This expression specifies everything
needed to build the package down to the system-level. These expressions are
saved in files with a ".nix" extension.

Nix-friendly software will provide these Nix expressions as part of their
source. If some software doesn't offer a Nix expression, you can always use an
externally authored expression.

What makes Nix unique is that these expressions specify a way to build that's

- precise
- repeatable
- guaranteed not to conflict with anything already installed

For some, it's easy to miss the degree to which Nix-built packages are precise
and repeatable. Nix builds in highly controlled sandbox environments. If you
build a package from a Nix expression on one system and then build the same
expression on a system of the same architecture, you should get the same result.
In many cases, the built artifacts will be identical bit-for-bit.

A system of thorough hashing accomplishes this degree of precision. In Nix, the
dependencies needed to build packages are also themselves Nix packages.  Every
Nix expression has an associated hash calculated from the hashes of the
package's dependencies and build instructions. When we change this dependency
(even if only by a single bit), the hash for the Nix expression changes. This
new hash cascades to a different calculated hash for any package relying on this
dependency. But if nothing changes, all systems will calculate identical hashes.

The repeatability and precision of Nix form the basis of how substituters are
trusted as caching services across the world. It also allows us to trust remote
builds more easily without worrying about deviations in environment
configuration.

Nix has a central substituter at https://cache.nixos.org, but there are
third-party ones as well, like [[garnix][Garnix]] and [[cachix][Cachix]]. Before building a package, the
hash for the package is calculated. If any configured substituter has a build
for the hash, it's pulled down as a substitute. A certificate-based protocol is
used to establish the trust of substituters. Between this protocol and the
algorithm for calculating hashes in Nix, you can have confidence that a package
pulled from a substituter will be equivalent to what you would have built
locally.

Finally, all packages are stored in =/nix/store= by their hash. This simple
scheme allows us to install multiple versions of the same package without
conflicts. References to dependencies all point back to the desired version in
=/nix/store= they need. Though Nix has not eliminated the risk of concurrently
running different versions of the same program, at least the flexibility to do
so is in the user's hands.

** Nixpkgs

Nix expressions help us create highly controlled environments to build packages
precisely. However, Nix still calls the conventional build tools of various
programming language ecosystems. Under the cover, Nix is ultimately a strictly
controlled execution of Bash scripts orchestrating these tools.

The Nix community curates a [[nixpkgs][Git repository of Nix expressions called Nixpkgs]].
This repository has Nix expressions for all the packages provided by the [[nixos][NixOS]]
operating system, as well as common Nix expressions used to build packages.

Most Nix expressions for packages will start with a snapshot of Nixpkgs as a
dependency. This way, the complexity of shell scripting and calls to
language-specific tooling can be kept mostly hidden away from Nix packaging
expressions.

* Frustrations acknowledged

Having covered so many of Nix's strengths, it's good to be aware of some
problems the Nix community is still working through.

** Nixpkgs takes time to learn

There are parts of Nix that are notably simple. For example, there's an elegance
to the hashing calculation and how =/nix/store= is used. Furthermore, the Nix
language has a small footprint, making learning Nix easier.

However, because of the complexity of all the programming language ecosystems,
there are a /lot/ of supporting libraries in Nixpkgs to understand. There are
over two million lines of Nix in Nixpkgs, some auto-generated, increasing the
odds of getting lost.

The [[nixpkgs-manual][official Nixpkgs manual]] only seems to cover a fraction of what package
authors need to know. Invariably, people seem to master Nix by exploring the
source code of Nixpkgs, supplemented by example projects for reference. You can
get surprisingly far mimicking code you find in Nixpkgs that packages something
similar to what you have in front of you. But understanding what's going on so
you avoid simple mistakes can take some time.

Various people have attempted to fill the gap with documentation and tutorials.
Even this document you're reading now is one such attempt. However, we're
missing a searchable index of all the critical functions in Nixpkgs for people
to explore. Something as simple as parsed [[docstring][docstrings]] as an extension of the Nix
language would go a long way, which would be far easier to implement than
something more involved, like a type system for the Nix language.

** Confusion of stability

The Nix community seems divided into the following camps:

- those who want new features and fixes to known grievances
- those who want stable systems based on Nix in industrial settings.

These groups don't need to be at odds. Unfortunately, Nix has released
experimental features in a way that has created confusion about how to build
stable systems with Nix.

*** Nix 2.0 and the new =nix= command

An early complaint of Nix was the non-intuitiveness of Nix's original assortment
of command-line tools. To address this, Nix 2.0 introduced a unifying CLI tool
called =nix=. Despite appreciable improvements in user experience, the newer
=nix= command has taken some time to get enough functionality to replace the
older tools (=nix-build=, =nix-shell=, =nix-store=, etc.). For a while, it's
ended up yet another tool to learn.

If you look at the manpage for the latest release of =nix=, there's a clear
warning at the top:

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Warning: This program is experimental, and its interface is subject to change.
#+END_QUOTE

This warning has been there since 2018, when Nix 2.0 was released.

However, =nix repl= is the only way to get to a [[repl][REPL session]] in Nix, which is an
important tool for any programming language. The previous tool providing a REPL
(=nix-repl=) has been removed from Nixpkgs.

Because something as basic as the REPL is only available with an experimental
feature, the Nix community is confusing guidance on using Nix with some
stability.

Eventually, with the release of Nix 2.4, experimental features were turned into
flags that needed to be explicitly enabled by users. One of these flags was
=nix-command=, which now gates users from any subcommand of =nix= beyond =nix
repl=. However, because so many users already use the new =nix= command, the
experimental =nix-command= feature is enabled by default if no experimental
features have been configured explicitly.

In other words, Nix ships with an experimental feature enabled by default.

Enabling the new =nix= command by default almost indicates it isn't too
unstable. However, Nix 2.4 did indeed change the API of =nix= subcommands.
Industrial users scripting against =nix= had to figure out the appropriate
changes.

In practice, the =nix= subcommands are relatively reliable. They are
well-written and functionally robust. However, the core maintainers reserve the
right to change input parameterization and output formatting without bumping a
major version number.

They communicate this risk only with the warning atop the manpage, which most
users have been training one another to ignore.

*** Flakes as an experiment

Though Nix expressions have an incredible potential to be precise and
reproducible, there have always been some backdoors to break the reliability of
builds. For example, Nix expressions have the potential to evaluate differently
depending on the setting of some environment variables like =NIX_PATH=.

The motivation for these relaxations of determinism has been a quick way to let
personal computing users have a convenient way to manage their environments.
Some people are careful to avoid accidentally having non-deterministic builds.
Still, accidents have occurred frequently enough for the community to want
better. It's frustrating to have a broken build because someone else set an
environment variable incorrectly.

Nix 2.4 corrected this by introducing an experimental feature called /flakes/.
Flakes provide an ergonomic way to manage build environments, with more
guarantees of determinism. A nice benefit of strictly enforced determinism is
the ability to cache evaluations of Nix expressions, which can be expensive to
compute.

All this is generally good news. Flakes address problems that industrial users
of Nix have long had to deal with.

However, flakes are an experimental feature that users need to enable
explicitly. Similar to the =nix= command, across versions, the inputs and
outputs of flake-related subcommands might change slightly. Furthermore, the
hashes computed by flakes can change as well. Such changes have already
happened.

On top of this, because flakes are experimental, documentation of flakes is
fractured in the official documentation. It almost seems like the Nix developers
are delaying proper documentation until there's a declaration of stability. A
preferred alternative would be developing documentation concurrently with the
implementation, using the documentation's comprehensibility to inform the
software's design. Good opportunities for redesign can be found in features that
prove difficult to explain.

All this puts industrial Nix users in an annoying place. Not using flakes and
instead of coaching coworkers and customers on how to use Nix safely

- increases the likelihood of defects as people make honest mistakes
- reduces the likelihood of adoption because people get frustrated with poor
  ergonomics and difficulty understanding nuances and corner cases.

However, if industrial users move to flakes to address these problems, we have
the following problems:

- we have to be ready for the flakes API to change, as it's technically
  experimental
- we have to accept some added training hurdles since the documentation of
  flakes is tucked behind documentation of non-flake usage.

*** Nix quick releases compete with stability

The latest major version of the Nix package manager is currently Nix
{{{nix-latest}}}, but NixOS {{{nixos-latest}}}, the latest stable release of
NixOS, uses Nix {{{nix-stable}}}. NixOS is the primary way the Nix package
manager gets used in the field. Far fewer users install Nix as a package manager
atop another operating system. From a community perspective it makes sense to
consider Nix {{{nix-stable}}} the stable release of the package manager. This
version gets the most scrutiny and critical bug fixes.

As mentioned above, there are strong reasons to use still-experimental features,
particularly flakes. However, APIs and calculated hashes change too frequently
in experimental features from version-to-version. By sticking with the version
used in NixOS, we get less breaking changes. For example, the [[file:../flake.lock][flake.lock]] file
included with this project has calculated hashes for dependencies. These hashes
were computed with Nix {{{nix-stable}}}, and could change with later versions.

For these reasons, the [[file:nix-installation.org][installation guide included with this project]] recommends
installing Nix {{{nix-stable}}}, rather than the latest official release.

** A few gaps in determinism

Nix offers world-class build determinism, especially with flakes. But it's
important to understand that this determinism is not infallible. To date, no
build system can claim to provide flawless determinism.

Consider a hypothetical compiler that can auto-detect that a build machine has
many cores, and enables an optimization upon detection incompatible with
machines with fewer cores. While Nix will generate different hashes if the
platform architecture changes, say from X86 to ARM, it will not consider a
machine with many cores different from one with fewer. So our example optimizing
compiler could cause a frustrating problem. A local build on a machine with few
cores may work as expected. But if a cache had a optimized build from a machine
with many cores, it would be pulled down for the same hash, as a substitute for
a local build. This optimization would lead to defects running on the wrong
machine.

Note that in general, we benefit from downloading and running packages built on
more powerful machines, and in almost all cases, the clever optimizations of
various compilers are portable.

Lapses in determinism caused by Nix expressions in Nixpkgs are generally
considered defects and handled through GitHub issues. Some may argue that this
is the best that we can do.

Most people will never encounter such corner cases in practice, but it's
important to understand the limitations of an otherwise extremely strong
guarantee of determinism.

* Encouraging development with flakes

This project encourages the development of Nix projects using flakes. The
benefits seem to outweigh the risks of instability. This choice is not made
lightly, and this document is an exercise of due diligence to inform users of
compromises.

Flakes are the future in Nix. They significantly address prior pains.
Furthermore, enough people worldwide are using them that we have some confidence
that the Nix commands are robust.

Using Nix with flakes should lead to a mostly pleasant experience. There are
some things to look out for, though.

** Limiting usage of experimental APIs

If you write scripts that call =nix= commands or use flakes, they may break
slightly if you upgrade to a newer version of Nix. For example, the formatting
of standard output for a command might change.

By calling =nix= with a few extra arguments ~--extra-experimental-features
'nix-command flakes'~ we can access flakes commands for single invocations
without enabling flakes globally. You can even make an alias for your shell that
might look like the following:

#+begin_src sh :eval no
alias nix-flakes = nix --extra-experimental-features 'nix-command flakes'
#+end_src

This way, there's less to type interactively. Just don't script against this
command, so there's no worry of scripts breaking due to experimental features.

** Keeping Nix version consistent

You may find that you need to pin the version of Nix to the same version for all
your machines (because hashes could change between versions, which are saved in
=flake.lock= files).
