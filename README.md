# About the project<a id="sec-1"></a>

This project has the “shajra” keyboard mappings for four ergonomic split keyboards:

-   [Keyboardio's Model 100](https://shop.keyboard.io), programmed with [Kaleidoscope](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope) firmware
-   [Keyboardio's Model 01 (discontinued)](https://shop.keyboard.io), also programmed with [Kaleidoscope](https://github.com/keyboardio/Kaleidoscope)
-   [ZSA Technology Labs' Moonlander](https://www.zsa.io/moonlander/), programmed with [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm) firmware
-   [ZSA Technology Labs' Ergodox EZ](https://ergodox-ez.com), also programmed with [QMK](https://docs.qmk.fm).

Beyond the keymap, this project offers some streamlined automation with [Nix](https://nixos.org/nix) that you can use for your own keymap. Or you can use this automation to return your keyboard to its factory default.

This automation only works for GNU/Linux (not MacOS or Windows). If you're new to Nix, this project bundles a few guides to get you started:

-   [Introduction to Nix and motivations to use it](doc/nix-introduction.md)
-   [Nix installation and configuration guide](doc/nix-installation.md)
-   [Nix end user guide](doc/nix-usage-flakes.md)
-   [Introduction to the Nix programming language](doc/nix-language.md)

The rest of this document discusses using this automation. To get the most out of the keymap itself, you may be interested in the [design document](doc/design.md) explaining the motivation behind the mapping.

# The mappings<a id="sec-2"></a>

The “shajra” keymaps for all four keyboards are highly similar, which works out well because the physical layouts of these keyboards are also similar. We can more easily switch from one keyboard to another and retain the design benefits of the mapping.

## Model 100 and Model 01 “shajra” keymap<a id="sec-2-1"></a>

![img](doc/model-100-shajra-layout.png)

## Ergodox EZ “shajra” keymap (Moonlander similar)<a id="sec-2-2"></a>

![img](doc/ergodox-ez-shajra-layout.png)

Note the Moonlander keyboard is an almost identical layout to the EZ and not illustrated here. The Moonlander has only two fewer keys on the thumb cluster. This leads to not having either Home or End on the base layer for the Moonlander (they are still in a function layer). And the "application menu" keycodes are moved to the bottom-outer corners.

# Using these key mappings<a id="sec-3"></a>

This project only supports a GNU/Linux operating system (sorry, not MacOS or Windows) with the [Nix package manager](https://nixos.org/nix) installed.

QMK and Kaleidoscope have build complexities and dependencies that can take a moment to work through. Nix can automate this hassle away by downloading and setting up all the necessary third-party dependencies in a way that

-   is highly reproducible
-   won't conflict with your current system/configuration.

Using Nix, we won't have to worry about downloading QMK or Kaleidoscope, ensuring we have the correct versions of build tools like Arduino, without messing with Git submodules or setting up environment variables. Nix does all this for us. The provided scripts simplify using Nix even further.

The following steps will get your keyboard flashed.

## 1. Install Nix on your GNU/Linux distribution<a id="sec-3-1"></a>

If you don't have Nix installed and configured on your system, follow the [instructions provided](doc/nix-installation.md). As discussed, setting up Cachix and enabling the experimental *flakes* feature are both recommended.

## 2. Make sure your udev rules are set<a id="sec-3-2"></a>

To program either keyboard with a new mapping, you need to augment your OS configuration with new udev rules.

The following are recommended rules for each keyboard:

    # For Ergodox EZ
    ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="04[789B]?", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}="1"
    ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="04[789A]?", ENV{MTP_NO_PROBE}="1"
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="04[789ABCD]?", TAG+="uaccess"
    KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{idVendor}=="16c0", ATTRS{idProduct}=="04[789B]?", TAG+="uaccess"
    
    # For Moonlander
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0483", ATTRS{idProduct}=="df11", \
        TAG+="uaccess", SYMLINK+="stm32_dfu"
    
    # For Model 100
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="3496", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0005", \
        SYMLINK+="model100", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}:="1", \
        ENV{ID_MM_CANDIDATE}:="0", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="seat"
    
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="3496", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0006", \
        SYMLINK+="model100", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}:="1", \
        ENV{ID_MM_CANDIDATE}:="0", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="seat"
    
    # For Model 01
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1209", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2300", \
        SYMLINK+="model01", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}:="1",   \
        ENV{ID_MM_CANDIDATE}:="0", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="seat"
    SUBSYSTEMS=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1209", ATTRS{idProduct}=="2301", \
        SYMLINK+="model01", ENV{ID_MM_DEVICE_IGNORE}:="1",   \
        ENV{ID_MM_CANDIDATE}:="0", MODE="0666", TAG+="uaccess", TAG+="seat"

These settings should roughly correspond to the official documentation of tools and libraries used by this project:

-   [QMK documentation for configuring Halfkey bootloader used by the Ergodox EZ](https://docs.qmk.fm/#/flashing?id=halfkay)
-   [Teensy CLI documentation, used internally for flashing the Ergodox EZ](https://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader_cli.html)
-   [Wally CLI, used internally for flashing the Moonlander](https://github.com/zsa/wally/blob/master/dist/linux64/50-wally.rules)
-   [Kaleidoscope documentation](https://kaleidoscope.readthedocs.io/en/latest/setup_toolchain.html#a-name-arduino-linux-a-install-arduino-on-linux)

Note, if the `MODE="0666"` settings above are not set, you may require root-privileges (sudo) to call the flashing scripts.

Each distribution is different, but on many GNU/Linux systems, udev rules are put in a file in `/etc/udev/rules.d` with a ".rules" extension.

On some systems, you can activate these rules with the following commands:

```sh
udevadm control --reload-rules udevadm trigger
```

Or just restart the computer.

## 4. For Kaleidoscope, join the necessary OS group<a id="sec-3-3"></a>

> ***NOTE:*** You don't need this step if you're flashing the Ergodox EZ or Moonlander.

Once udev is configured, when you plug in the Keyboardio Model 01, a serial device should appear under `/dev/serial/by-id` with a name matching "usb-Keyboardio\_Model\_01\_\*". This human-readable symlink pointing to the device should be something like `/dev/ttyACM0`. On many systems, this device is group-owned by the "dialout" or the "uucp" group:

In the following example, we can see the device is group-owned by the "dialout" group.

```sh
ls -lL /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Keyboardio_Model_01_*
```

    crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 Dec 28 20:09 /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Keyboardio_Model_01_Ckbio01E-if00

On most distributions, the following commands should work to join a group (substituting `$TTY_GROUP` and `$USERNAME`):

```sh
sudo usermod -a -G $TTY_GROUP $USERNAME
newgrp $TTY_GROUP
```

You should see memberships in the new group with the `groups` command:

```sh
groups | grep dialout
```

    users wheel video dialout docker

## 5. Unplug and replug your keyboard<a id="sec-3-4"></a>

Unplug your keyboard and plug it back in to ensure everything's set to program. Rebooting your computer is probably overkill, but would probably work too.

## 6. Flash your keyboard<a id="sec-3-5"></a>

This project provides four scripts:

-   `flash-ergodoxez`
-   `flash-model01`
-   `flash-model100`
-   `flash-moonlander`

Calling these scripts without arguments will flash your respective keyboard with the "shajra" keymap. There is a "&#x2013;factory" switch to flash your keyboard back to a factory default keymap.

If you enabled flakes in your Nix installation, you can run these scripts without installing them. Here's an invocation illustrating doing so with `flash-ergodoxez`:

```sh
nix run github:shajra/shajra-keyboards#flash-ergodoxez
```

    
    Flashing ZSA Technology Lab's Ergodox EZ (custom "shajra" keymap)
    =================================================================
    
    FLASH SOURCE: /nix/store/k2bh09w0iv8z8wczqx1lg03pz54chacx-qmk-builtin-shajra-src
    FLASH BINARY: /nix/store/l2j0i0955arwm8ydjvv6wdgid29a28yb-ergodoxez-builtin-shajra.hex
    
    ⠋ Press the reset button of your keyboard

The same works for the other three flashing scripts. Just replace "flash-ergodoxez" in the invocation above with the script of your choice.

Alternatively, the four flashing scripts are provided at the root of this project. Just clone this repository, and you can call them directly:

```sh
cd $SOME_WORKING_DIR
clone https://github.com/shajra/shajra-keyboards.git
cd shajra-keyboards
./flash-ergodoxez
```

Note that the first time you run the commands described below, you'll see Nix doing a lot of downloading and compiling. After that, subsequent invocations should be quicker with less output.

### Flashing an Ergodox EZ keyboard<a id="sec-3-5-1"></a>

When flashing with `flash-ergodoxez`, you will be prompted to press a reset button. Access this button with an unbent paperclip inserted into the small hole in the top right corner of the right keyboard half.

### Flashing a Moonlander keyboard<a id="sec-3-5-2"></a>

When flashing with `flash-ergodoxez`, you will be prompted to press a reset button. Access this button with an unbent paperclip inserted into the small hole in the top left corner of the left keyboard half.

### Flashing a Keyboardio keyboard<a id="sec-3-5-3"></a>

When flashing with `flash-model100` or `flash-model01`, you will be prompted with instructions to hold down the `Prog` key, and then press `Enter`.

The `Prog` key is hardwired to be the top-left-most key of the Keyboardio Model 01, but the `Enter` key can be remapped. If you forget where the `Enter` has been mapped to on your Keyboard, you can hit `Enter` on another connected keyboard.

# Reverting to the factory default mapping<a id="sec-4"></a>

This project's scripts won't save off your previous keymap from your keyboard. But we can revert to the OEM keymap that your keyboard shipped with.

Reverting to the OEM keymap can be done with the `-F` / `--factory` switch, which all the flashing scripts support. If you forget your options, these scripts have a `-h` / `--help` switch.

# Customization<a id="sec-5"></a>

## Customizing keymaps<a id="sec-5-1"></a>

The provided code is relatively compact. In the `keymaps` directory, you should find familiar files you would edit in QMK or Kaleidoscope projects, respectively. These keymaps are compiled into the flashing scripts provided with this project.

For both keyboards, The “shajra” keymap is in its own directory. You can make your own keymaps and put them in a sibling directory with the name of your choice, and they'll be compiled in as well.

If you don't want to use keymaps compiled into the flashing scripts, you can use another directory of keymaps at runtime with the `-K` / `-keymaps` switch.

Then you can use the `-k` / `--keymap` switch to load your custom keymap by the name you chose for the keymap in the "keymaps" directory. The scripts should pick up changes, rebuild anything necessary, and flash your keyboard.

The used keymap source code is copied into `/nix/store`, and the invocation of the flashing scripts will print out a "FLASH SOURCE:" line indicating the source used for compiling/flashing for your reference. These are the whole source trees you'd typically use if following the QMK or Kaleidoscope documentation manually.

## Development<a id="sec-5-2"></a>

This project relies heavily on Nix, primarily to help deal with all the complexity of setting up dependencies. The development of this project also relies on an experimental feature of Nix called *flakes*, not required to use the project. See the included [introduction to Nix](doc/nix-introduction.md) if you're new to Nix or flakes.

If you want to check that everything builds before flashing your keyboard, you can build locally everything built by this project's continuous integration:

```sh
tree $(nix build --no-link --print-out-paths) 2>/dev/null
```

# Release<a id="sec-6"></a>

The "main" branch of the GitHub repository has the latest version of this code. There is currently no commitment to either forward or backward compatibility. However, the scripts for compiling/flashing are considered stable and less likely to change than the “shajra” keymap.

"user/shajra" branches are personal branches that may be force-pushed to. The "main" branch should not experience force-pushes and is recommended for general use.
